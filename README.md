In this project, I was given code for setting up the initial training environment of the game, as well as helper functions having to do with the game in Python. My task was to complete the training function using the Q-Training Algorithm.

Computer Scientists use computers to address problems. In this case, it means building an AI which can solve a game in an optimal way. As a computer scientist, I try my best to approach a problem in a client oriented and well researched way. I create programs which fit the requirements given by the customer to the best of my ability. I also research both established and newly developing methods for solving the problem while I am doing it to find the best solution. I have an ethical responsibility to give the end user and organization the results of my best efforts. This means delivering a product which is safe, protects privacy, and is built with optimal speed and memory occupation.
